# React Quiz Application

## Overview
This React Quiz app is designed to test knowledge of React-related concepts. It features a timed quiz, local high score management, and is built with a focus on performance and clean state management using Reactâ€™s `useReducer` hook. The quiz questions are dynamically fetched from a GitHub Gist.

## Features
- **Timed Quiz**: Users have a limited time to answer each question, adding a layer of challenge.
- **High Score Management**: Scores are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to track their best results.
- **State Management**: State is managed using the `useReducer` hook, ensuring all app behavior is consolidated into a single state with dispatch actions.
- **Dynamic Questions**: Quiz questions are fetched from an external GitHub Gist.

## Technologies Used
- **React JS**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **useReducer Hook**: For managing complex state with a single reducer and dispatch actions.
- **CSS**: For styling the quiz interface.
- **Local Storage**: To store high scores persistently across sessions.
- **GitHub Gist**: For fetching quiz questions.
